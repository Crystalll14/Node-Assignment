• Define Monolithic architecture
A unified architecture where there is no separation between services or components of the application.

• Explain microservices in your own understanding
Microservices are like building blocks for software applications. Instead of creating one big piece of software, you break it down into smaller, independent parts that each do one thing well. These parts can be updated and scaled independently, which makes the whole system more flexible and reliable. 

• Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?
Microservices architecture because this architecture involves breaking down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed and deployed separately and it can make the application more flexible and scalable.


• Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?
No, but it is possible to achieve application speeds similar to multithreaded languages and it does provide mechanisms for multithreading in certain scenarios.
